# kundalini-awakening-technically
There is lot of fear around the power of kundalini shakti and the destruction it can cause while noone ever hardly talks about the actual process. Reason is mostly noone wants to discuss the final solution and rather kundalini awakening remains a high ticket spiritual product to be sold to elite or uber classes. Here is the collection of all of the actionable steps documented in recognised ancient books available in public domain freely

### Are the risks or fear around it justified ?
Not at all. Kundalini shakti is portrayed as some super-natural phenomenon and is often associated to paranormal or out of controlled psychic experiences (probably to justify the hype they create through price). And people are literally warned to not practice it as it can lead to undesired results. While the worst anyone can do with the kundalini-awakening practices is that they are not able to awaken the kundalini ever in their lifetime. The worst case is actually the normal case which everyone is already going through, facing aging, getting older with time as everyone do and hence dying because your body can't keep up the integrity with various failing organs. If you have never practised deep breathing then the first noticeable strange thing could be that you may feel some dizziness which is recognised completely normal. In general, you are always informed that don't practice anything forcefully mostly incentivised/initiated/implied/ motivated(can't recall the exact word I wanna say here :/) for quick gains.

### Why to care? What one can achieve through it?
Probably not every benefit that can be achieved through it is documented but the best documented case which I am particularly excited about is
>Mahāvedhoayamabhyāsānmahāsiddhipradāyakah  
>Valīpalitavepaghnah sevyate sādhakottamaih

>The practice of this mahâ Vedha, the giver of great
Siddhis, destroys old age, grey hair, and shaking of the
body, and therefore it is practised by the best masters. 

It is mentioned multiple times that aging can be conquered by the practitioner of it. I am particularly just interested for the part if I can live healthily, energetic with a strong body **throughout the lifespan(around a century).** *Who wants to live indefinitely?*

### Getting Started
>Udghātayetkapātam tu yathā kumchikayā hathāt  
>Kundalinyā tathā yogī mokshadvāram vibhedayet

>As a door is opened with a key, so the Yogî opens the
door of mukti by opening Kundalinî by means of Hatha
Yoga.
*105, Hathayoga Pradipika*
