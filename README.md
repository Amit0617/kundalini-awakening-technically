# kundalini-awakening-technically

There is lot of fear around the power of kundalini shakti and the destruction it can cause while noone ever hardly talks about the actual process. Reason is mostly noone wants to discuss the final solution and rather kundalini awakening remains a high ticket spiritual product to be sold to elite or uber classes. Here is the collection of all of the actionable steps documented in recognised ancient books available in public domain freely

## Are the risks or fear around it justified ?

Not at all. Kundalini shakti is portrayed as some super-natural phenomenon and is often associated to paranormal or out of controlled psychic experiences (probably to justify the hype they create through price). And people are literally warned to not practice it as it can lead to undesired results. While the worst anyone can do with the kundalini-awakening practices is that they are not able to awaken the kundalini ever in their lifetime. The worst case is actually the normal case which everyone is already going through, facing aging, getting older with time as everyone do and hence dying because your body can't keep up the integrity with various failing organs. If you have never practised deep breathing then the first noticeable strange thing could be that you may feel some dizziness which is recognised completely normal. In general, you are always informed that don't practice anything forcefully mostly incentivised/initiated/implied/ motivated(can't recall the exact word I wanna say here :/) for quick gains.

## Why to care? What one can achieve through it?

Probably not every benefit that can be achieved through it is documented but the best documented case which I am particularly excited about is
>Mahāvedhoayamabhyāsānmahāsiddhipradāyakah  
>Valīpalitavepaghnah sevyate sādhakottamaih

>The practice of this mahâ Vedha, the giver of great
Siddhis, destroys old age, grey hair, and shaking of the
body, and therefore it is practised by the best masters. 

It is mentioned multiple times that aging can be conquered by the practitioner of it. I am particularly just interested for the part if I can live healthily, energetic with a strong body **throughout the lifespan(around a century).** *Who wants to live indefinitely?*

## Getting Started

>Udghātayetkapātam tu yathā kumchikayā hathāt  
>Kundalinyā tathā yogī mokshadvāram vibhedayet

>As a door is opened with a key, so the Yogî opens the
door of mukti by opening Kundalinî by means of Hatha
Yoga.  

>Tasmātsarvaprayatnena prabodhayitumīśvarīm  
Brahmadvāramukhe suptām mudrābhyāsam samācharet

>In order, therefore, to awaken this goddess, who is
sleeping at the entrance of Brahma Dwâra (the great
door), mudrâs should be practised well.  

>Mahāmudrā mahābandho mahāvedhaścha khecharī  
Uddīyānam mūlabandhaścha bandho jālandharābhidhah  
Karanī viparītākhyā vajrolī śaktichālanam  
Idam hi mudrādaśakam jarāmarananāśanam

>Mahâ mudrâ, mahâ Bandha, mahâ Vedha, Khecharî,
Uddiyâna Bandha, mûla Bandha, Jâlandhara Bandha.
Viparîta Karanî, Vajroli, and Śakti Châlana. These are
the ten mudrâs which annihilate old age and death.

>Pādamūlena vāmena yonim sampīdya dakshinām  
Prasāritam padam krtvā karābhyām dhārayeddrdham

>Pressing the Yoni (perineum) with the heel of the left
foot, and stretching forth the right foot, one should hold it firmly with both hands. (*its toe should be grasped by the thumb and first finger.*)

>Kanthe bandham samāropya dhārayedvāyumūrdhvatah  
Yathā dandahatah sarpo dandākārah prajāyate  
Rjvībhūtā tathā śaktih kundalī sahasā bhavet  
Tadā sā maranāvasthā jāyate dviputāśrayā

>By stopping the throat (by Jâlandhara Bandha) the air is
drawn in from the outside and carried down. Just as a
snake struck with a stick becomes straight like a stick, in
the same way, śakti (susumnâ) becomes straight at once.
Then the Kundalinî, becoming as it were dead, and,
leaving both the Idâ and the Pingalâ, enters the susumnâ
(the middle passage).

>Tatah śanaih śanaireva rechayennaiva veghatah  
Mahāmudrām cha tenaiva vadanti vibudhottamāh

>It should be expelled then, slowly only and not
violently. For this very reason, the best of the wise men
call it the mahâ mudrâ. This mahâ mudrâ has been
propounded by great masters.

>Iyam khalu mahāmudrā mahāsiddhaih pradarśitā  
Mahākleśādayo doshāh kshīyante maranādayah  
Mahāmudrām cha tenaiva vadanti vibudhottamāh

>Great evils and pains, like death, are destroyed by it, and
for this reason wise men call it the mahâ mudrâ.

>Chandrāngghe tu samabhyasya sūryāngghe punarabhyaset  
Yāvattulyā bhavetsangkhyā tato mudrām visarjayet

>Having practised with the left nostril, it should be
practised with the right one; and, when the number on
both sides becomes equal, then the mudrâ should be
discontinued.

>Na hi pathyamapathyam vā rasāh sarveapi nīrasāh  
Api bhuktam visham ghoram pīyūshamiva jīryati

>There is nothing wholesome or injurious; for the
practice of this mudrâ destroys the injurious effects of
all the rasas (chemicals). Even the deadliest of poisons,
if taken, acts like nectar.

>Kshayakushthaghudāvartaghulmājīrnapuroghamāh  
Tasya doshāh kshayam yānti mahāmudrām tu yoabhyaset

>Consumption, leprosy, prolapsus anii, colic, and the
diseases due to indigestion,—all these irregularities are
removed by the practice of this mahâ mudrâ.

>Kathiteyam mahāmudrā mahāsiddhikarā nrnām  
Ghopanīyā prayatnena na deyā yasya kasyachit

>This mahâ mudrâ has been described as the giver of
great success (Siddhi) to men. It should be kept secret
by every effort, and not revealed to any and everyone.
